CSGC 2022 robotics code

This is the (incomplete) code intended for the 2022 Colorado Space Grant Consortiom sand dunes robotics challenge
To compile to arduino, install the platform.io extension for VS code.

Depending on your target board, you may want to change the pin values in Pins.h to correspond with your motor pins. main.cpp contains example code
in this instance

you will either also have to change the configuration in the platform.io extension or modify the target in the files
